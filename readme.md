This project implements the SlimSerializer extracted from Azos (https://github.com/azist/azos).

It is adapted to enable portable serialization format between older frameworks. The project is compatible with .NET 4.5.2, .NET Standart 2.1 and .NET 5.0 Frameworks. 

We recommand extensive testing of your data structure serialization before using this software. Only use it if the original Serializer from Azos does not answer your needs.
